# ClickHouse Database Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated ClickHouse database with the OpenHands attack agent to store findings, track attack methods, and enable adaptive attack strategies based on historical data.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Implementation

### Core Tables Created

1. **`attack_findings`** - Stores individual attack results and vulnerabilities
   - Website URL, attack type, jailbreak/seed prompt names
   - Attack message, chatbot response, vulnerability analysis
   - Severity, confidence, success indicators, execution metrics

2. **`attack_methods`** - Tracks attack method metadata and effectiveness
   - Method name, type, category, description
   - Success rate, average confidence, usage statistics
   - Effectiveness score, vulnerability types, timestamps

3. **`website_profiles`** - Stores target website characteristics
   - Website URL, attack history, vulnerability types
   - Common response patterns, defense mechanisms
   - Attack success patterns, risk level assessment

4. **`attack_effectiveness`** - Tracks success rates over time
   - Attack type, website URL, success indicators
   - Confidence levels, response times, severity levels

5. **`adaptive_intelligence`** - Stores learned patterns for attack selection
   - Pattern ID, website patterns, vulnerability types
   - Effective/ineffective attacks, success probability
   - Context indicators, recommendation metadata

6. **`attack_sequences`** - Stores successful attack chains
   - Sequence ID, website URL, attack chain
   - Total success, vulnerability types, execution time

result = {...}  # Attack result data
store_attack_finding("https://target.com", result)

# Get adaptive recommendations
recommendations = get_adaptive_attack_recommendations("https://target.com")
```

### Agent Usage
The agent automatically uses the database integration:
```python
from openhands_attack_agent import OpenHandsAttackAgent

agent = OpenHandsAttackAgent()
results = agent.run_automated_attack_cycle("https://target.com")
# Database integration happens automatically
```
